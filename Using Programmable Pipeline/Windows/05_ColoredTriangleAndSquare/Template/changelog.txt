changes made from perspective code:

1)	created gVbo -> gVbo_Traingle_Pos
	created new gVbo as gVbo_Triangle_Color
	created gVbo -> gVbo_Square_Pos
		

2)	created vbo_color array for RGB multicolor 

3)	Did the 6 step procedure for vbo_color just like vbo_pos

4)	same for square except its color

	used glVertexAttrib3f(index,x,y,z) for coloring square
	
5)	uninitialize all buffers

NOTE://TO DO 
	The program crashes after the usage of glEnableVertexAttribArray(index)
	Need to search why is it crashing
